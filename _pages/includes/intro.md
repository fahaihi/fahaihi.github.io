I am a Ph.D. candidate from the Nankai University (NKU) and Nanyang Technolgical University (NTU). My research area includes AI Compression, Parallel Computing, and Bioinformatics.
I'm services as a reviewer of ICASSP-25, IJCNN-25, and WWW-25 etal.

<p style="color:blue;">
I am seeking positions as a postdoctoral researcher, assistant professor, or in industry. My current research focuses on models and data in the era of large models, exploring AI-driven methods to establish intrinsic connections among 'data-algorithm-system' to reconstruct compression systems. If there are relevant opportunities, please do not hesitate to contact me via sunh@nbjl.nankai.edu.cn. Thanks!
